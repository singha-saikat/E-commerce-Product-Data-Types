                "value": "256GB"
            }
        ],
        "inventory": {
            "quantity": 50,
            "inStock": true
        }
    }
}
## Inventory Management

### Inventory Update Logic

When creating a new order (`/api/orders`), the following steps should be taken to update the inventory:

1. **Check Available Quantity:**
   - Verify if the available quantity in inventory is sufficient to fulfill the order.
   - If the ordered quantity exceeds the available quantity, return an error response indicating insufficient stock.

2. **Update Inventory:**
   - **Reduce the Quantity:** Decrease the quantity of the ordered product in the inventory by the ordered amount.
   - **Update `inStock` Status:**
     - If the remaining inventory quantity is zero, set the `inStock` property to `false`.
     - If the remaining inventory quantity is greater than zero, keep the `inStock` property as `true`.

### Sample Error Response for Insufficient Stock

If the ordered quantity exceeds the available quantity, the API should return the following error response:

```json
{
    "success": false,
    "message": "Insufficient quantity available in inventory"
}
